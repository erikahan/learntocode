    <h1>The Opossum of the Future
  </h1>

  <p>ONE day an Opossum who had gone to sleep hanging from the highest 
branch of a tree by the tail, awoke and saw a large Snake wound 
    about the limb, between him and the trunk of the tree.</p>


   <p>"If I hold on," he said to himself, "I shall be swallowed; if I let 
     go I shall break my neck."</p>

<p>  But suddenly he bethought himself to dissemble.</p>

 <p> "My perfected friend," he said, "my parental instinct recognises in 
you a noble evidence and illustration of the theory of development.  
You are the Opossum of the Future, the ultimate Fittest Survivor of 
our species, the ripe result of progressive prehensility - all 
   tail!"</p>

  <p>But the Snake, proud of his ancient eminence in Scriptural history, 
was strictly orthodox, and did not accept the scientific view.</p>
